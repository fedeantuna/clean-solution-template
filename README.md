## Code Coverage Report

This template uses DeepSource as the tool for code analysis and reporting on test coverage. In order to set it up, you need to create an account at https://deepsource.io/ and then allow access to the your repository. Once that is done, you need to add the DSN to your repository secrets under the name DEEPSOURCE_DSN. You can take a look here https://deepsource.io/docs/dashboard/repo-settings/#dsn to know more about how to do it.
